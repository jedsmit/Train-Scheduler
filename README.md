# Train-Scheduler
This app allows the user to enter a train name, destination, train frequency, and the first time that train leaves the station.  The input data is stored in a firebase database. The app then updates the train schedule with that information as well as the time the next train arrives. It also displays the number of mintues until the next arrival.
